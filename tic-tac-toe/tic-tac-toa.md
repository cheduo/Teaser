The rule of tic-tac-toe can be found in  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe  
input the state of the board, and try to find the optimal play

e.g.  
input:  
  1. board:  
  x.o  
  .x.  
  ...  
  2. player:  
  o  

the function should return:  
  f(board, player):  
  x.o  
  .x.  
  ..o  

implement function f

Here I give a short Python solution.
